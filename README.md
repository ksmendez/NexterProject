# Nexter Project

This is the third project from [Jonas Schmedtmann's, Advanced CSS and Sass Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). This project consised of building a responsive landing page by using CSS Grid layout method.

NOTE:

I DID NOT use the `devserver` as I had bugs with refreshing and the window just closing itself.

Instead I used the [`LiveServer` extension by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). You can also use the [Live Preview extension from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).

## Installation

Install the necessary NPM packages.

```bash
  npm install
```

Run and watch Sass files.

```bash
  npm run watch:sass
```

Compile Sass.

```bash
  npm run build:sass
```

## Deployment

I deployed the website through Netlify.
